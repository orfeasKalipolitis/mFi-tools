# About
This adds MQTT features to Ubiquiti Networks mFi devices.

This is version 4, which does not aim to comply with [homie MQTT convention](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie), as I don't see the appeal. 

ItÂ´s forked from the excelent work of a lot of projects, follow the proverbial string if interested.

# mFi device Credentials
If you have managed to adopt your device into a controller, then the username and password will match those credentials, if not, you probably still have the default ubnt:ubnt.

# Compatible Devices
- mPower Mini and mPower Outlet 3 Ports

- mFiTHS, mFiCS, mFiMSW and mFiDS

# Warning
Use at your own risk! These devices are OLD and DEPRECATED. Installing custom software on them is definitely not advisable and you should not be doing that if you have no clue what you are doing.
The openssl package on the mPower devices is running deprecated TLS and as such is a major PITA to connect to through ssh or make any other kind of encrypted communication.

# Installation
Use the download script to download all the necessary files locally.
Copy the downloaded files over to the mFi device.
Because of the old openssl package, we need to set the exchange and cipher to something that the mFi device understands.

```
scp -o KexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -c aes256-cbc -r locallySavedMQTTfolder user@mFiDeviceIP:/var/etc/persistent
```

Use an SSH client and connect to your mFi device.

```
ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 user@mFiDeviceIP -c aes256-cbc
```

Make sure that the files are saved in the following structure:
- everything is in /var/etc/persistent/mqtt (the binaries and library should be exactly there)
- /var/etc/persistent/mqtt/client should contain all the scripts needed

Run the install-only script. [Configure](#Configuration). Save and reboot.

```
save
reboot
```

# Starting
```
/var/etc/persistent/mqtt/client/mqrun.sh
```
The script also starts automatically approx 3 minutes after booting the device (using rc.poststart).

# Stopping
```
/var/etc/persistent/mqtt/client/mqstop.sh
```

# Configuration
## MQTT
Edit the file `/var/etc/persistent/mqtt/client/mqtt.cfg` and configure your server, topic and refresh time. Setting topic, refresh, mqttusername and mqttpassword is not mandatory. Defaults are 
`topic=homie/[name of the mpower]` and `refresh=60` seconds

```
mqtthost=192.168.0.1
#refresh=60
#topic=my/topic
#mqttusername=myMqttUserName
#mqttpassword=myMqttPassword
port1=mFiTHS
port2=mFiCS
port3=
```
## Configuring transmitted node attributes
You can suppress certain attributes (such as voltage) by editing the file `mpower-pub.cfg`. Set value to `0` if you dont need the data.

```
#enable (1) or disable (0) properties here
relay=1
power=1
energy=1
lock=1
voltage=0
mFiTHS=1
mFiCS=1
mFiMSW=1
mFiDS=1
```

# mPower Published data

The mPower device will publish messages every 60 seconds to different topics. Example:

```
homie/mpower-1/port1/relay=0
homie/mpower-1/port2/relay=1
homie/mpower-1/port3/relay=0
homie/mpower-1/port1/power=0.0
homie/mpower-1/port2/power=7.2
homie/mpower-1/port3/power=0.0
homie/mpower-1/port1/energy=0
homie/mpower-1/port2/energy=4
homie/mpower-1/port3/energy=8
homie/mpower-1/port1/voltage=0.0
homie/mpower-1/port2/voltage=234.9
homie/mpower-1/port3/voltage=0.0
```

Additionally - currently only at the start of the script - the device will also report:

```
homie/mpower-1/$homie=2.1.0
homie/mpower-1/$name=mpower-1
homie/mpower-1/$fw/version=MF.v2.1.11-mq-0.2
homie/mpower-1/$fw/name=mPower=MQTT
homie/mpower-1/$localip=192.168.1.26
homie/mpower-1/$nodes=port1,port2,port3
homie/mpower-1/$stats/uptime=2589629.67
homie/mpower-1/port1/relay/$settable=true
homie/mpower-1/port2/relay/$settable=true
homie/mpower-1/port3/relay/$settable=true
homie/mpower-1/port1/lock/$settable=true
homie/mpower-1/port2/lock/$settable=true
homie/mpower-1/port3/lock/$settable=true
```

# mPort Published data

The mPort device will publish messages every 60 seconds to different topics. Example:

```
homie/mport-1/port1/mFiTHS 28.610001
homie/mport-2/port2/mFiCS
homie/mport-3/port3/mFiMSW

or

homie/mport-3/port1/mFiMSW
homie/mport-3/port1/mFiDS
```

Additionally - currently only at the start of the script - the device will also report:

```
homie/mport-1/$homie 3.0.0
homie/mport-1/$name mport-1
homie/mport-1/$fw/version MF.v2.1.12-mq-0.2
homie/mport-1/$fw/name mFi MQTT
homie/mport-1/$localip (null)
homie/mport-1/$nodes port1,port2,port3
homie/mmport-1/$stats/uptime 5441.57

# Control sockets via MQTT
You can control the sockets by sending `0` or `1` to the topic `<topic chosen above>/port<number of socket>/relay/set`

You can lock the sockets by sending `0` or `1` to the topic `<topic chosen above>/port<number of socket>/lock/set`

# logfile
The tool logs into standard messages log.
```
tail -f /var/log/messages
```
# Integrating into Home Assistant

This is an example how to define Home Assistant / Hassio.io items:

# mPort

sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Temperature"
    state_topic: "homie/mport-1/port1/mFiTHS"
    unit_of_measurement: "Celcius"
    icon: mdi:temperature-celsius
    value_template: "{{ value | round(2) }}"

# mPower

switch:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "mPower-1"
    state_topic: "homie/mpower-1/port1/relay"
    command_topic: "homie/mpower-1/port1/relay/set"
    payload_on: "1"
    payload_off: "0"
    retain: true  
```
# Integrating into openHAB (Not Tested)

This is an example how to define openHAB items:

```
Switch switchmp "My mpower switch" { mqtt=">[mosquitto:homie/mpower1/port1/relay/set:command:ON:1],>[mosquitto:homie/mpower1/port1/relay/set:command:OFF:0],<[mosquitto:homie/mpower1/port1/relay:state:MAP(mpowerrelay.map)]"}
Number energymp "Energy consumption [%d Wh]" { mqtt="<[mosquitto:homie/mpower1/port1/energy:state:default]" }
Number powermp "Current power [%.1f W]" { mqtt="<[mosquitto:homie/mpower1/port1/power:state:default]" }
```

You need a `mpowerrelay.map` file:
```
0=OFF
1=ON
```
